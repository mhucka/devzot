Scripts and programs I developed to work with a combination of [DEVONthink](https://www.devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink), a personal database and information management system, and [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org), a bibliographic reference management system.

## Introduction

In the process of using [DEVONthink](https://www.devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink) and [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org) together, I've been developing scripts to automate various procedures. This repository contains the results.


## Installation

## Usage

## Known issues and limitations

The solutions and code in this repository were developed over a period of years spanning multiple releases of [DEVONthink](https://www.devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink) and [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org) in my sometimes idiosyncratic macOS environment. While they work for me (or did at the time I put them here), it is possible they will not work in your environment or in the version of DEVONthink that you are using. Caveat utilitor!
